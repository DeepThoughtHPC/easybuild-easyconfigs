description = """PhyloPhlAn is an integrated pipeline for large-scale phylogenetic profiling
 of genomes and metagenomes. PhyloPhlAn is an accurate, rapid, and easy-to-use method for
 large-scale microbial genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis at multiple levels
 of resolution. PhyloPhlAn can assign both genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)
 to species-level genome bins (SGBs). PhyloPhlAn can reconstruct strain-level phylogenies
 using clade-specific maximally informative phylogenetic markers, and can also scale to
 very-large phylogenies comprising >17,000 microbial species.
